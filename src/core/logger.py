"""
Structured logging (level, timestamp, module) for every module in the
codebase, replacing the ad-hoc print() calls that made pipeline output
impossible to filter/aggregate in Airflow or any log tool.

Usage:
    from src.core.logger import get_logger
    logger = get_logger(__name__)
    logger.info("bronze data written to: %s", bronze_uri)
    logger.warning("no observations returned for series=%s", series)

All loggers here are children of the "src" logger, which owns the single
handler/formatter -- get_logger() only needs to run _configure() once.
